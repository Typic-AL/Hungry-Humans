OFFICIALLY ON THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE

This is my first attempt at creating a 3d mobile game. I developed this on and off for about a year and I am very excited that it finially released. It is currently pending for review on the app store as well.

A brief description of the game:
Hungry Humans is a survival game where your hunger drives every move and decision. You start as a small, hungry human looking for food scattered across the map. Every bite you take is a step closer to survival and growth, but the timer runs out without eating quickly enough, and your hunger will consume you.
